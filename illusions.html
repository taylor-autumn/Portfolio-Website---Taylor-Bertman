            <p class="info">Optical Illusion - Museum of Illusions:</p>
            <p class="moreInfo">This project was a bit more fun and experimental for me, because, when given the prompt of making an optical illusion in code, I immediately thought of viral black/blue or gold/white dress that was very culturally relevant during my childhood. I ended up making it seem like a "museum of illusions," crafting two dresses on mannequin stands, one of each color, and incorporating 2 modes: a Difference Mode and a Lerp Mode. On Difference Mode, the player holds a circle that flips the color of the dress so that, upon inspection, the dress appears to be the opposite color. And on Lerp Mode, the player can watch the dresses fade into the color of the other one, back to its original color, and loop again. This assignment was fun for me because I got to experiment a lot with different blend modes as well as Lerping between colors, and also because I got to dabble in a bit of pop culture.</p>
