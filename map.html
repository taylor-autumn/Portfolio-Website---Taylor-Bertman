            <p class="moreInfo">The prompt for this assignment was to create an unconventional clock that tracks time in a way other than the standard time. I have always been interested in Astrology, and this was the first thought that came to my mind when given this prompt. I designed the signs and the planet myself, and found a way to cycle them in order with the current sign and the time period on the top of the frame. This assignment made me think about how, if we did not have our conventional way of time, we would probably turn to a lot of natural elements such as the cycling of the stars as a way to tell time, and it was a fun assignment that challenged me to think critically.</p>
