            <p class="info">Exquisite Corpse - Lilli the Lab Rat:</p>
            <p class="moreInfo">This assignment overall was a nice whimsical break during mid-semester where I got to prioritize story and visuals more than intricate coding. This was a group project with two other people where we essentially folded a paper into 3 sections and each drew a body part, and when we unfurled it we got this beautiful speciman right here. After first drawing it, we then put it into code, comobined it, and got working on the story of our individual body parts and how each part came together to form this exquisite corpse. Overall this assignment was fun and got my creative mind thinking more, and was a nice break where I was just allowed to have fun!</p>
            <p class="info">The Story:</p>
            <p class="moreInfo">The head of our monster was once an alien named Lab Rat. To no one's surprise, he was a scientist alien who got a little too experimental and ended up blowing his alien face off from one of his experiments so he replaced his face with the all too familiar lab tube shape it has today. Naturally, Lab Rat was a greedy little test tube and decided he wanted to take over New York City, so he traveled to Earth. The disproportionate torso belonged to Barnaby Worthington, whose entire purpose was a loud, expensive plea for attention. He didn't believe in research, only spectacle. The lower half of our monster used to be a famous runner in a weird race called Catch the Chicken. His legs were super strong but his brain was completely empty—running after chickens was all he knew. Once all 3 of our guys arrived in New York City, they decided it would be a great day to swim in the Hudson River. But as they went into the water, the water began to glow an unnatural green. AAAAA POOF POOF POOF. This is when Barnaby's colossal chest instantly merged with Lab Rat and the runner, and they became the new glowing, disproportionate biological being we come to know as Lilli, short for alien. Now radioactively abstracted together, Lilli aspires to conquer New York City and climb the Corporate Chain.</p>
