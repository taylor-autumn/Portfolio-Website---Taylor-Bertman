            <p class="moreInfo">This was one of the earlier coding assignments we had, and for this one I had already come from a reasonable coding background that provided me with more comfort to push the bounds of what I did not know cause I already knew how to make the foundation. For instance, changing the features of the face itself was easy, but decisions I made to challenge myself and make it unique were like adding the tongue and teeth on a probability system, or adding the aspect of the canvas and the paint to give it an overacrching theme and also give the user the abiltiy to change the color. Although this assignment overall is simple, it was one of the first steps in helping me learn more in p5 and it most definitely contributed to my growth this semester.</p>
