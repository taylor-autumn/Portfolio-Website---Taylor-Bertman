            <p class="info">P5 Sketch - Jamie's Lost Place:</p>
            <p class="moreInfo">This assignment was our first assignment of the semester when we were getting to know how to draw and place things in p5. This was a partner project where our partners described a place to us and we were tasked with re-envisioning it in p5 code. My partner Jamie's place was described as an old simple playground located in the woods where you could see the sun set. This is where my partner spent a lot of her time in her childhood with her friends. She told me that the playground was very colorful and had the classic playground equipment like a slide and swings. I added the seesaw as the finishing touch. I think this project was beneficial in terms of making me thinking creatively and trying to bring Jammie's place back to life as best as I possibly could.</p>
