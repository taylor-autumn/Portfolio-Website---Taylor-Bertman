            <p class="moreInfo">When given the prompt of making an autobiographical game, I decided to turn my outside endeavors of working in theatrical stage management into a game. I decided to go about this by summarizing the stage management experience in phases that are represented through mini games. The aim of the game is to be funny and whimsical, hence the comedic music choices and cartoony graphics, while also giving the player a glimpse into the life of Stage Management. The game also intentionally induces development, as some of the levels require multiple attempts to build skill, and also increase in difficulty as time goes on.</p>
