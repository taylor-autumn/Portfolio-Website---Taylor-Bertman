            <p class="info">Abstract Comic Tracker:</p>
            <p class="moreInfo">My data portrait at its base tracks the amount of screen time I had reading digital comics in one week. Everytime the flower shape grows and shrinks is one day, the speed at which is grows and shrinks illustrates how long or short the hours of the day were, and the color of the flower illustrates how many hours, with darker colors like red and orange signifying longer hours and light green and green signifying shorter hours. So for example, a fast moving light green flower that barely grows before shrinking again would symbolize a short day, while a flower that is dark red and slowly grows until it overtakes the screen would symbolie a long day. Overall, I made the tracker to be an abstract shape to force the viewer to think when they look at it and really consider what each day signifies, and I think that message was evidently communicated well here.</p>
